## Deployment

Install Xammp using the following link:
https://www.apachefriends.org/es/index.html

Go to the folder where Xammp was installed and then access the following location /xampp/htdocs . There you can create folders in order to deploy web pages. To do so, go to your browser and visit: localhost/folderName, then you will see the web page only if an index file exist, add "/filename" with an php or html extensión to test other files.

By default xampp read the "htdocs" folder to show web pages but you can change it if you prefer, visit to following link for more information: https://bobcares.com/blog/xampp-change-htdocs-location-windows/
